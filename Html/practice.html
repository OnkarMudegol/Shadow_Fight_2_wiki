    <p id="p1">Shadow is the protagonist and the main character of Shadow Fight 2.
         He is the character that the players control throughout the game. 
         Shadow is a legendary warrior driven by his arrogance to seek a worthy opponent matching his skills. 
         In the process, he ends up opening the Gates of Shadows and loses his physical body to the Demons who are hence unleashed. 
         Seeking to retrieve the demon seals and close the Gates of Shadows once again, he intends to lock away the evil he has unleashed upon the world.
